Welcome to Rhubarb PHP
======================

Rhubarb PHP is an application development framework allowing you a robust, fast and secure platform
for your next project.

## How does Rhubarb differ from other great frameworks like Laravel, Symphony 2 and Cake PHP?

Rhubarb shares much of the best of these frameworks but emphasises three main themes

1. Performance: Rhubarb rejects string parsing routes and filters in favour of object trees. Rhubarb
supports autoloading but tries to avoid it by requiring dependant classes. Rhubarb keeps the complexity
of framework features low reducing overall code paths to a minimum.

2. Modularity: A Rhubarb module can, just by including it, configure models, schemas, url handling and
presenters. And after inclusion any aspect of those features can be amended, retired or even completely
supplanted to best fit with your application.

3. MVP: Rhubarb showcases a Model-View-Presenter library that provides an excellent way to build
unit tested, view abstracted user interfaces through reusable objects.
